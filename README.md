# Audio Seven - Repository @chendodev

## Introduction

The ideas that I capture in my projects, are born from nothing, but they point to the same goal, to improve, and to share my knowledge.

## **How to use!**
At times it is not an application created directly for mobile, you must serve it locally with your favorite Code Editor or host it on a server.

It doesn't use a database, so you won't be able to upload songs directly, although you can create a database for it.

## **How to upload songs:**
You do not need extreme knowledge to be able to use it, just know a little HTML, and you can move through the folders.
In the project there is a folder inside assets called, **audio**, in this folder you must load all the songs you want. 

Then you enter the folder **db**, and the file, *json.js*. 
This file is the one I use as a database, it is not complicated, you just have to leave it to your liking, as you leave it, it is how it will appear in the playList.

Clarifying that you must place the same name of your songs in the property, **track:**, I know it may sound a bit complicated, but you can do it. :)

**How to serve it:**
If you want to serve it locally, in visual studio code there is an extension
call, **live server**, just install it, and serve the project from:

*index.html*
